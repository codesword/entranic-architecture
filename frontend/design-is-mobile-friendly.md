### Design is mobile-friendly
The app should be very responsive and hence look and work well on different screen sizes. We will use [meta viewport](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ui/responsive/fundamentals/set-the-viewport?hl=en) to ensure the app is optimized for multiple devices.

Although we are building a progressive mobile first web app, our app should still work fine in a desktop browser.

We will be following [google material design spec](https://material.io/guidelines/#) while building out our mobile friendly app.
